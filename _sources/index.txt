Welcome!
========

Welcome to Toyplot, the kid-sized plotting toolkit for Python with grownup-sized goals:

* Change the world with beautiful interactive, animated plots that embed using only client-side rendering.
* Create the best possible data graphics "out-of-the-box", maximizing data ink and minimizing chartjunk.
* Provide a clean, minimalist interface that scientists and engineers will love.
