Installing Toyplot
==================

.. important:: **The Toyplot Sources Aren't Available Yet**

  This is embarassing, but we're still waiting for our lawyer-gnomes to
  finalize the copyright on Toyplot's source code.  Toyplot will be released
  under a BSD-style license as soon as that happens, but in the meantime,
  the following instructions won't work ... apologies!

  Contact Timothy M. Shead <tshead@sandia.gov> if you have questions or
  would like to be notified when Toyplot is released.

Using Your OS Package Manager
-----------------------------

Your operating system package manage manager (apt, yum, MacPorts, etc) should
be your first stop for installing Toyplot - using your package manager will
make it easy to install Toyplot and its dependencies, keep them up-to-date, and
even (gasp!) uninstall them cleanly.  If your package manager doesn't support
Toyplot yet, drop them a line and let them know you'd like them to add it!

Using Pip / Easy Install
------------------------

If your package manager doesn't support Toyplot, or doesn't have the latest
version, your next option should be Python setup tools like `pip` (preferred)
or `easy_install`.  You can always install the latest stable version of toyplot
and its dependencies with::

    $ pip install toyplot

or::

    $ easy_install toyplot

From Source
-----------

Finally, if you want to work with the latest, bleeding-edge Toyplot goodness,
you can install it from source code, but you'll need to have its dependencies
installed first:

* Python 2.7 - http://python.org
* numpy 1.8.1 - http://numpy.org

If you want to generate PDF, PNG, Postscript, PDF, or MP4 versions of your Toyplot figures:

* cairo, pango, pangocairo - typically installed using pygtk - http://www.pygtk.org

The following isn't needed to run Toyplot once it's installed, but you need it
in order to run the setup script itself:

* setuptools - http://pythonhosted.org//setuptools

Now, you're ready to install Toyplot::

    $ git clone https://github.com/sandialabs/toyplot
    $ cd toyplot
    $ python setup.py install
